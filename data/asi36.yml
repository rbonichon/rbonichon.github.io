  title: Introduction
  descr: >-
    This introductory session presents an overview of the contents, the issues
    surrounding security in general, the more restricted issue of analyzing
    vulnerabilities in low-level code, as well as reminders regarding
    compilation and code analysis.

  title: Basic attacks and exploitation
  descr: >-
    This session presents the basic low-level attack techniques: 

      * buffer overflows; 
      * heap overflows; & 
      * format string exploitation. 

    Most of the session is allotted to hands-on experimentation.

  title: Control-flow integrity
  descr: >-
    This session presents the three main basic binary exploitation mitigation techniques:

      * stack canaries; 
      * data execution prevention; & 
      * ASLR. 

    We will also talk about their
    limitations and briefly present more advanced control-flow integrity
    measures that are currently available.
      
    A good part of the session is allotted to hands-on experimentations.
