  title: Introduction
  descr: >-
    This introductory session presents an overview of the contents, the issues
    surrounding security in general, the more restricted issue of analyzing
    vulnerabilities in low-level code, as well as reminders regarding
    compilation and code analysis.

  title: Basic attacks & exploitation
  descr: >-
    This session presents basic low-level attack techniques: 

      * buffer overflows; 
      * heap overflows; & 
      * format string exploitation. 

    Most of the session is allotted to hands-on experimentation.

  title: Control-flow integrity
  descr: >-
    This session presents three main basic binary exploitation mitigation techniques:

      * stack canaries; 
      * data execution prevention; & 
      * ASLR. 

    We will also talk about their
    limitations and briefly present more advanced control-flow integrity
    measures that are currently available.
      
    A good part of the session is allotted to hands-on experimentations.

  title: Exam
  href: exam
  descr: >-
    The final exam will contain 2 parts:

      * The presentation of a research article (groups of 2, 20 minutes + questions) -- rank the articles
        from the list in decreasing order and send a message ranking them to the professors;
        (see list here) ;
      * A mini CTF problem (find the secret key!) and its **written** solution
        report (5p. max).

      The CTFs are available from https://github.com/rbonichon/asi36-ctf
