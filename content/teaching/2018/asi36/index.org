  Software attacks are extensively hitting the headlines nowadays. This course
  aims at demystifying them by giving the fundamentals to understand these
  attacks, what they consist in and how to protect from them. We will mostly
  focus on software vulnerabilities.

  We will cover the following topics:

  - semantics and modelization of low-level languages
  - classical attack and exploitation
  - control-flow integrity techniques
  - MATE attacks and reverse engineering
  - code obfuscation
  - malware: principles and analysis
