Software attacks are a common part of today's headlines. This course aims at
demystifying them by giving the fundamentals to understand these attacks, what
they consist in and how to mitigate them. We will mostly focus on software
vulnerabilities.

We will cover the following topics:

  - semantics and modelization of low-level languages
  - classical attack and exploitation
  - control-flow integrity techniques
  - MATE attacks and reverse engineering
  - code obfuscation



*Note:* These lectures will require a fair amount of hands-on
experiments on the computer to make the concepts more practical. 
They also involve supplementary reading material as part of the contents.
